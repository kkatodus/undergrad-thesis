abstract = {We study the problem of measuring group differences in choices when the dimensionality of the choice set is large. We show that standard approaches suffer from a severe finite-sample bias, and we propose an estimator that applies recent advances in machine learning to address this bias. We apply this method to measure trends in the partisanship of congressional speech from 1873 to 2016, defining partisanship to be the ease with which an observer could infer a congressperson's party from a single utterance. Our estimates imply that partisanship is far greater in recent years than in the past, and that it increased sharply in the early 1990s after remaining low and relatively constant over the preceding century.},

abstract = {We describe latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), a generative probabilistic model for collections of discrete data such as text corpora. LDA is a three-level hierarchical Bayesian model, in which each item of a collection is modeled as a finite mixture over an underlying set of topics. Each topic is, in turn, modeled as an infinite mixture over an underlying set of topic probabilities. In the context of text modeling, the topic probabilities provide an explicit representation of a document. We present efficient approximate inference techniques based on variational methods and an EM algorithm for empirical Bayes parameter estimation. We report results in document modeling, text classification, and collaborative filtering, comparing to a mixture of unigrams model and the probabilistic LSI model.},

 abstract = {A general nonlinear logit model is used to analyze political choice data. The model assumes probabilistic voting based on a spatial utility function. The parameters of the utility function and the spatial coordinates of the choices and the choosers can all be estimated on the basis of observed choices. Ordinary Guttman scaling is a degenerate case of this model. Estimation of the model is implemented in the NOMINATE program for one dimensional analysis of two alternative choices with no nonvoting. The robustness and face validity of the program outputs are evaluated on the basis of roll call voting data for the U.S. House and Senate.},

abstract = {We scale theoretical/ideological positions of economic research institutes over debates. Using only parts of German research institutes’ business cycle reports that deal with economic policy advice as an example, we extract sections from these reports dealing with monetary and fiscal policy issues from 1999 to 2020. To these corpora, we apply methods of unsupervised text scaling (Slapin and Proksch, 2008; Lauderdale and Herzog, 2016), namely Wordfish and Wordshoal. Roughly, results are in line with common sense in the public policy discourse. For monetary policy texts, we observe a strong, but short-lived consensus in debate-specific positions at the height of the financial crisis in 2008 and a larger polarization thereafter compared to the sample period before. For the fiscal policy text corpus, the polarization was similarly high before and after the crisis and decreases somewhat during the COVID-19 pandemic. For both policy areas, the German Institute of Economic Research (DIW), Berlin, and the Institute for World Economics (IfW), Kiel, tend to be the most diverse institutes within the spectrum of latent ideological positions. We argue that text-mining techniques might be useful to scale underlying ideological positions in policy-related publications.}
